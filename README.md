# About Me

## My Interests
Bass guitar - I love playing music. I play a few stringed instruments, and my favorite is the bass.  
Fishing - I love to fish, as well. Coincidentally, my favorite species to target is the bass.  
Programming - I have been trying to learn the fundamentals for over a decade, and I hope to get better from these classes.  


## Websites I recommend
[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) - This is a great free resource where I began learning Python, JavaScript, and much more. The modules are browser-based with a lot of sturcture, and easy to follow.  
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) - This is another fantastic free site for HTML, React, and NodeJS to name a few. It has less hand-holding and explicit steps, but offers more challenge and independence than FCC.  
[Sound Rivers](https://soundrivers.org/) - Want to keep our rivers clean? Looking for an opportunity to borrow a kayak for free, paddle with a large group, and help your local waterways? Click to learn more.
